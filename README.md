This repo contains assignment solution for Drona Aviation's Python developer internship.


## Q1 -Simulated Drone Movement System

You are tasked with developing a Python program that simulates the movement of a drone using the Turtle module. The program should be designed to allow the drone to move in four directions: forward, backward, left, and right.
Requirements:
1. Utilize the Turtle module for graphical representation.
2. Design functions that control the drone's movement: move_forward, move_backward, move_left, and move_right.

## Q2 - TCP Socket Communication

Develop two Python programs that can send and receive messages to each other using TCP sockets.
Requirements:
1. Create a sender program (sender.py) and a receiver program (receiver.py).
2. The sender program should be able to establish a TCP connection and send messages to the receiver.
3. The receiver program should be able to accept incoming connections and display received messages.
4. Implement error handling for socket operations.
